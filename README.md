### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am web developer working with React, React Native, JavaScript, Python, Node, Express, MongoDB and SQL. 
My background is in media production and visual art. I became a dad at the very beginning of the pandemic
and decided to go back to school at NSCC for Full Stack Web Application Development. This post-gradudate program concentrates on using the MERN stack and understanding many web development tools like GitHub, Agile Methodologies, Software Testing, Networks, Operating Systems, and working at the command line. 

This program ended in June 2023 and I am now on the job hunt! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Cyber Security Program hosted by Digital Nova Scotia, which focuses on using Python and AWS. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some Wordpress sites, building apps with 3rd party APIs and misc. React projects. I also like to dabble in Unity and C# when I have the time.

âš¡ Fun fact: I worked for 4+ years as a 35mm Projectionist in a historic Cinema in rural Nova Scotia!
